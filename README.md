# DareData Knowledge Center

Knowledge sharing and mentoring according to the [DareData vision, mission, and values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1upQ3JWDGGgO_fT1hTEpwdUSXq8yYu0yumAqKb02QLfI/edit?usp=sharing).

## DareData Values

## Organization

The knowledge center will be organized in the following way:

1. This repo for governance of the knowledge center itself. Anything that does not apply
directly to one of the topics can go here. Use issues to open discussions.
1. A slack workspace for chat and notifications (TODO).
1. A slack channel dedicated to each topic.
1. A repo dedicated to each topic.

## Topics

We will pre-select a set of topics that are directly relevant to the areas of data science
and data engineering. These topics will have a defined scope. Here we will list each
of the topics and link to their repos.

- MLOps
- Software Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Analysis
- Data Engineering
- etc.
